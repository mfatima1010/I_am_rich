# i_am_rich

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The "I Am Rich" app is a simple application that displays an image of a gem or diamond along with a message indicating that the user is rich. Although the app doesn't offer any functionality, it gained popularity due to its high price on certain platforms.

To create the "I am rich" app in Flutter, you can follow these steps:
Step 1: Set up a new Flutter project
Create a new Flutter project using your preferred development environment. You can use the Flutter command-line interface or IDEs like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio to create the project.

Step 2: Design the user interface
In the lib folder of your Flutter project, create a new file called main.dart. 

Step 3: Add the diamond image
Create a folder called assets in the root of your Flutter project. Inside the assets folder, create another folder called images. Place an image of a diamond inside the images folder and name it diamond.png.

Step 4: Update the pubspec.yaml file
Open the pubspec.yaml file located in the root of your Flutter project. Add the following lines under the flutter section to specify the asset path:
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/

Step 5: Run the app
Connect a device or start an emulator, and then run the app using your preferred development environment. You should see the app with a simple title bar and a centered image of a diamond.
