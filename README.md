# i_am_rich

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The "I Am Rich" app is a simple application that displays an image of a gem or diamond along with a message indicating that the user is rich. Although the app doesn't offer any functionality, it gained popularity due to its high price on certain platforms.

To create the "I am rich" app in Flutter, you can follow these steps:
Step 1: Set up a new Flutter project
Create a new Flutter project using your preferred development environment. You can use the Flutter command-line interface or IDEs like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio to create the project.

Step 2: Design the user interface
In the lib folder of your Flutter project, create a new file called main.dart. 

Step 3: Add the diamond image
Create a folder called assets in the root of your Flutter project. Inside the assets folder, create another folder called images. Place an image of a diamond inside the images folder and name it diamond.png.

Step 4: Update the pubspec.yaml file
Open the pubspec.yaml file located in the root of your Flutter project. Add the following lines under the flutter section to specify the asset path:
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/

Step 5: Run the app
Connect a device or start an emulator, and then run the app using your preferred development environment. You should see the app with a simple title bar and a centered image of a diamond.

Features:

    Image Display: The app displays a high-quality image of a diamond in the center of the screen.
    Title Bar: The app includes a title bar at the top, indicating the app's name ("I am Rich").
    Material Design: The app follows the principles of Material Design, providing a clean and visually appealing user interface.
    Asset Management: The app manages and displays the diamond image using Flutter's asset management system.

Usage:

    Status Symbol: The "I am Rich" app is primarily designed as a status symbol. It serves as a display of wealth and affluence for users who can afford the high price tag associated with the app.
    Minimalistic Approach: The app intentionally offers minimal functionality, focusing solely on displaying an image of a diamond. Its simplicity is part of its charm, as it emphasizes the idea of luxury and exclusivity.
    Conversation Starter: The app can serve as a conversation starter or an icebreaker, as people may notice it on a user's device and inquire about its purpose or meaning.
